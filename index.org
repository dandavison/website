* 
I'm a postdoc in [[http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/academic_staff/peter_donnelly][Peter Donnelly]]'s group, in the Statistics Department
at Oxford University. I use population genetic data to study
population structure, speciation and 'species-level' systematics. I'm
currently working on analyses of large data sets of SNP genotypes of
humans in the UK and continental Europe. I did my Ph.D. in the
Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago,
working in [[http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu][Jonathan Pritchard]]'s group and in the Bird Division of the
Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago with [[http://fm1.fieldmuseum.org/aa/staff_page.cgi?staff=hackett][Shannon Hackett]].

* Population genetics software
** [[file:software/shellfish/shellfish.org][shellfish]]
   PCA for very large data sets of SNP genotypes. Computations are
   automatically performed in parallel on a computing cluster, and on
   a single multi-processor machine.
** [[./software/psi.org][psi]]
   Parallel implementation of the Pritchard et al. (2000) "Admixture Model" (EM, MCMC or VB)
* Other software
** [[./software/lines-and-slice.org][lines and slice]]
   Rapid extraction of lines and columns from tabular text
   files. Especially useful for large files, such as genome-wide
   genotype data.
** [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-R/org-R.php][org-R]]
   An interface for using =R= code within emacs org-mode.
