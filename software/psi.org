* psi: parallel structure inference [contact me if you want to use this]
  This software fits the 'admixture model' described by Pritchard et
  al. (2000) Genetics (2):945-959, to SNP genotype data. The model may
  be fitted using either MCMC (as described by the original authors),
  Variational Bayes (unpublished), or the EM algorithm. The EM fit
  (and potentially the others) may be carried out in parallel on a
  compute cluster with some version of MPI installed. In that case the
  speed-up is roughly linear in the number of processors allocated to
  the task.
