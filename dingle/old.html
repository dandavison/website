<li> 3-4 Nov 2007 wooding party [Paul, Charlie, Martin, Julia, Dan, Will, Tom Watkins]
    Plenty of wood cut & stacked for wood-burner; lots of hand-sawable stuff also in
    woodshed; most pre-cut Sandymount woodpiles used up; several large Sycamore limbs
    felled resulting in 3 or 4 fresh woodpiles and several large twiggy limb-ends lying
    in Sandymount which will be suitable for kindling and smaller fire wood when dry. [Dan]
<li> 28 March 2007 Builder Simon Davison is making a start on dormer window
   repairs this week.

    <li> WOODING PARTY 4th and 5th March 2007 (Will and Friends, Paul, Andy, Ann,
    Charlie):  Large amount of wood for the wood-burner was cut, split and
    stacked. Also lots of easily saw-able wood (dry, seasoned and broom-stick to
    drain-pipe thickness) for the sitting room fire has been left in the wood
    shed. The saws in the kitchen wood cupboard have good sharp blades. A new
    'Stihl' chainsaw has been bought by Paul and works brilliantly. Future wood
    stocks are in very good supply and a second wooding and coppicing weekend is
    fixed for the weekend of 3rd/4th November 2007.
    <li> HOUSE:  The window frame in the dormer above the kitchen has deteriorated
    further. Rotten wood has now broken and a couple of glass panes fallen out.
    A temporary cardboard repair is in place to keep the wind and weather out.
    The anti-damp work on the larder wall (digging out soil mounded up against
    the outside) seems to be working well and the walls are much less damp, in
    spite of recent wet conditions.
    <li> OUTSIDE: All of the area is still very wet and muddy with lane and tracks
    very churned up by the machinery and vehicles used during the dyke
    strengthening work on the marsh. The combination padlock on the gate at
    Sandymount is now on again, ready for the spring and summer tourist and
    camping season.
